    <!-- Ordered list for the steps needed -->
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Start by washing and cutting the chicken into pieces, if it's not already done. Pat it dry with paper towels and set it aside.</li>
        <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pan or pot, heat the cooking oil over medium heat. Add the finely chopped onions and sauté until they become soft and translucent.</li>
        <li>Stir in the minced garlic and grated ginger. Sauté for a couple of minutes until the raw aroma disappears.</li>
        <li>Add the ground cumin, ground coriander, turmeric, chili powder, and a pinch of salt. Stir the spices into the onion mixture and cook for a few minutes until they release their aromas.</li>
        <li>Toss in the finely chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and the oil starts to separate from the mixture.</li>
        <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pot and brown them on all sides. This should take about 5-7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the chicken is browned, pour in the coconut milk (or yogurt) and stir to combine. Reduce the heat to low, cover the pot, and let the curry simmer for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is fully cooked. Make sure to stir occasionally.</li>
        <li>Season the chicken curry with garam masala, salt, and black pepper according to your taste. Garnish with fresh cilantro leaves (coriander)</li>
        <li>Your chicken curry is now ready to be served. It pairs wonderfully with steamed rice or naan bread.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your homemade chicken curry! You can adjust the spice level and consistency to your liking by adding more or less chili powder and coconut milk (or yogurt) as needed.</li>
