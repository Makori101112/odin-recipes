    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> If you don't have cold, day-old rice, cook the rice according to package instructions and then spread it out on a baking sheet to cool for about 30 minutes. Cold rice works best for fried rice.</li>
        <li>Heat the cooking oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the diced onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes until it becomes translucent. Add the minced garlic and sauté for an additional 30 seconds. Stir in the diced vegetables and cook for 3-4 minutes until they are tender-crisp.</li>
        <li>Push the cooked vegetables to one side of the skillet and pour the beaten eggs into the empty side. Scramble the eggs until they're fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Now, add the cold cooked rice to the skillet, breaking up any clumps. Mix it with the scrambled eggs and sauté for a few minutes to heat through.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the soy sauce and oyster sauce (if using) over the rice and stir to evenly distribute the sauce. Continue cooking for a few more minutes, allowing the rice to absorb the flavors.</li>
        <li>Season the fried rice with salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle sliced green onions on top for garnish.</li>
        <li>Your homemade fried rice is ready to be served as a delicious and satisfying meal. You can also add cooked chicken, shrimp, or tofu for added protein.</li>
    </ol>
