    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a small bowl, combine warm milk and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast on top, give it a gentle stir, and let it sit for about 5-10 minutes, or until it becomes frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture.</li>
        <li>Pour the yeast mixture, plain yogurt, and cooking oil (or ghee) into the well in the flour. Mix everything together to form a soft, slightly sticky dough.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough for about 5-7 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel, and let it rest in a warm, draft-free place for 1-2 hours, or until it doubles in size.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature setting (usually around 500°F or 260°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven.</li>
        <li>Punch down the risen dough and divide it into equal-sized portions. Roll each portion into a ball. You can also flatten and shape them into ovals or rounds using your hands or a rolling pin.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the naan on a hot pizza stone or a baking sheet. Bake for about 2-4 minutes, or until they puff up and turn golden brown. You can also cook them in a hot skillet on the stovetop if you prefer.</li>
        <li>While the naan is still warm, brush the surface with melted butter. For extra flavor, you can also sprinkle freshly chopped cilantro or garlic on top.</li>
        <li>Serve your homemade naan warm as a delightful accompaniment to your favorite curries or dishes.</li>
    </ol>
