# odin-recipes
It’s time to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired. 
In this project, I am are going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.
It’s important to keep in mind that this project is just to build my HTML chops.

# Odin Recipes

This project is also a part of my journey to learn Git and GitHub. In this repository. By the end of this project, I hope to have a collection of delicious recipes and a solid understanding of version control with Git.
